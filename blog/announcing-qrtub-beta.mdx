We're excited to open qrtub to BETA participants. After months of working with early users in marine, construction, equipment hire, and lifesaving stations, we're ready to expand access.

## What is qrtub?

qrtub is a QR code management platform designed for the reality of physical deployments. Unlike simple QR generators, qrtub handles the full lifecycle:

- **Bulk generation** for professional printing
- **Print-before-link** workflow (connect codes to assets later)
- **Profile Pages** with multiple destinations (one code, many systems)
- **Update without reprinting** (change where codes point anytime)

We've been working with early users in marine, construction, equipment hire, and lifesaving stations to refine these capabilities for real operational environments.

## What's Available in BETA

**Core Features:**
- Link generation (random, ID-based, custom)
- Profile Pages with multiple Destinations
- Direct Mode (single-destination redirects)
- Tub-based organization with custom fields
- Spreadsheet-style item management
- Dynamic URL parameters
- Import/export
- Track physical QR code media (stickers, signs, plaques)

**What We're Building:**
- Advanced Media lifecycle management
- Media Templates (reusable design templates)
- Media Batch tracking for production runs
- Cross-account transfer (for manufacturer → customer workflows)
- Granular permissions and sharing
- API access

## Who Should Join?

qrtub is built for organizations deploying QR codes at scale:

**Marine**
- Vessels, boats, and marine equipment requiring multiple access points
- Safety equipment and compliance documentation
- Service and maintenance tracking across distributed fleets

**Construction**
- Heavy machinery with inspections, maintenance, and operator manuals
- Equipment fleets across multiple sites
- Compliance and safety documentation

**Equipment Hire**
- Rental equipment with changing operators and customers
- Cross-hire workflows between companies
- Equipment handoff documentation

**Lifesaving & Emergency Services**
- Beach rescue equipment (rescue tubes, defibrillators)
- Multi-user access (lifeguards, emergency responders, public)
- Critical equipment status and service records

## BETA Program Benefits

**Early Access**

## What We Need From You

**Real-world Use Cases**
We're building for operational reality. Your deployment challenges help us build better features.

**Honest Feedback**
What works, what doesn't, what's missing. We're iterating rapidly based on user input.

**Patience**
BETA means some features are still in development. We'll be transparent about timelines and priorities.
