Local councils manage thousands of diverse assets across their municipality—parks, playgrounds, buildings, equipment, trees, signs, infrastructure. qrtub provides one QR code per asset that serves council staff performing inspections and maintenance, contractors servicing assets, and ratepayers who want to report issues or learn about their community facilities. Everyone sees the same page, each chooses what's relevant.

## The Challenge

Council asset management involves:
- Diverse assets (playgrounds, BBQs, park benches, buildings, trees, equipment, signage)
- Multiple departments (parks, facilities, infrastructure, fleet, environmental)
- External contractors performing maintenance across council assets
- Ratepayers wanting to report issues or understand facilities
- Compliance audits requiring asset inspection history
- Long asset lifecycles (playgrounds, buildings last 20-50+ years)
- Public accountability and transparency expectations
- Assets scattered across entire municipality

Traditional approaches create problems:
- Asset registers locked in office systems, inaccessible in the field
- No way for public to report issues directly against specific assets
- Contractors can't access asset history when performing maintenance
- Multiple systems across departments, no unified access
- Updating asset information requires office access
- Inspections recorded on paper, manually entered later
- No public visibility into council's asset management professionalism

## One Code Per Asset, All Audiences See Everything

Every council asset gets a single QR code. Everyone who scans sees the SAME Profile Page with ALL the buttons. Each person taps what's relevant to them.

**Example Profile Page (Playground Equipment):**
- Asset details and location (everyone sees this)
- "Playground Safety Inspection" → Council officers tap this
- "Log Maintenance" → Staff or contractors tap this
- "View Inspection History" → Managers tap this
- "Report Issue" → Ratepayers tap this
- "About This Facility" → Public information

**Here's the value:** Ratepayers see ALL the operational buttons (inspections, maintenance logs, work orders). They won't tap them, but seeing them demonstrates professional asset management—social proof that council manages community infrastructure properly with modern systems.

**Note on security:** The buttons are visible, but they're still protected. If someone taps "Playground Safety Inspection," they reach your inspection app which requires login credentials. The Profile Page shows what's available; your existing systems control who can actually access them.

**Public accountability in action:**

A parent at a playground scans the QR code on the equipment, sees:
- Playground equipment details and age rating
- "Playground Safety Inspection" button (council uses professional inspection systems!)
- "Log Maintenance" button (they track maintenance properly!)
- "View Inspection History" (transparency!)
- "Report Issue" button ← They tap this to report a damaged swing

**The operational buttons they won't use demonstrate professional asset stewardship.** Ratepayer trust increases when they see the infrastructure behind council asset management.

## The Professional Council Effect

Traditional thinking: Assets have ID tags. Asset register stays in office systems.

**qrtub approach:** Show everything. Public sees asset information PLUS operational infrastructure.

The curious ratepayer scanning a park asset sees:
- Asset information (what it is, when installed, specifications)
- Professional inspection systems (legitimacy)
- Maintenance tracking (accountability)
- Work order management (documentation)
- Direct issue reporting (engagement)

They think: "Council actually manages these assets professionally. I can report problems directly. My rates are being used well."

**Traditional asset tag:** Shows asset ID. No context. No public access.

**qrtub Profile Page:** Shows asset info + operational legitimacy + direct reporting + transparency. Public trust.

## Multi-Department, Unified Access

Different council departments, one system:

**Parks & Reserves Tub:**
- Playgrounds, BBQs, benches, bins, fountains, irrigation
- Park officers perform inspections
- Contractors log maintenance
- Public reports vandalism or damage

**Buildings & Facilities Tub:**
- Community centers, libraries, council chambers, depots
- Facilities team tracks maintenance
- Contractors access building systems
- Public reports facility issues

**Fleet & Equipment Tub:**
- Mowers, trucks, machinery, tools
- Fleet officers track servicing
- Operators log usage
- Workshop staff record repairs

**Urban Forest Tub:**
- Street trees, park trees, reserves
- Arborists perform health assessments
- Public learns about species, reports concerns
- Conservation officers track heritage specimens

**Infrastructure Tub:**
- Signage, bridges, drainage, pathways
- Engineers track condition assessments
- Contractors log works
- Public reports damage

Same platform. Different departments. Each sees only their assets. Unified access in the field.

## Bulk Deployment Across Asset Population

Deploy QR codes across entire council asset base:

**URL Templates example:**
```
yourinspectionapp.com/asset?id={assetID}&type={assetType}&location={location}&department={department}
```

Configure once. Tag 10,000 council assets. Each QR code automatically pre-fills inspection forms with that asset's ID, type, location, and responsible department—no per-asset configuration needed.

**Update without retagging:** Change inspection platforms, update contact details, switch contractors—physical tags stay unchanged for the 20-50 year life of assets.

## Real-World Example: Council Playground Equipment

Council tags playground equipment in a community park. Everyone sees the same Profile Page:

**Parks officer** (during monthly inspection):
- Tap "Playground Safety Inspection"
- Pre-filled form with equipment ID, location, last inspection
- Complete inspection, log findings
- System updates compliance register

**Council-appointed contractor** (performing maintenance):
- See all operational buttons (shows professional council systems)
- Tap "Log Maintenance"
- Record work performed
- Add photos of repairs

**Parent/ratepayer** (at the playground):
- Scan out of curiosity or to report issue
- See "Installed: 2018, Last inspected: 15/02/2025"
- See "Playground Safety Inspection" (council has professional systems!)
- See "Log Maintenance" (they track upkeep!)
- See "View Inspection History" (transparency!)
- Trust council's playground management
- Tap "Report Issue" if swing is broken

**Auditor** (reviewing playground compliance):
- Scan equipment during site visit
- Tap "View Inspection History"
- Access complete inspection records
- Verify compliance with Australian Standards

**Result:** Public sees professional asset management + direct reporting. Council demonstrates accountability. Ratepayer trust increases.

## Contractor Coordination

Multiple contractors across council assets need access without full system logins:

**Contractor sees:**
- Asset details and service history
- "Log Service Completion"
- Contact council asset officer
- Upload photos and notes

**Contractor doesn't see:**
- Other council assets not assigned to them
- Sensitive council information
- Other contractor details

**Council benefits:**
- Contractors log work completion directly
- Photos and timestamps documented
- No contractor training on council systems
- Work completion visible immediately
- Easy to switch contractors (update Destination, not physical tags)

## Public Issue Reporting with Context

Ratepayers report issues directly against specific assets:

**Traditional:** "There's a broken swing at Smith Park playground." Which playground? Which swing? Council staff search, guess, call back.

**With qrtub:** Ratepayer scans broken swing, taps "Report Issue," form auto-fills:
- Asset ID: PG-SMITH-SW-003
- Location: Smith Park, East side playground
- Asset type: Swing set
- Council officer: Parks Team (auto-routed)

Council receives specific, actionable report with asset context. Faster response. Better service.

## Integration with Council Systems

qrtub connects to the systems councils already use:

**Asset management:** TechnologyOne, Assetic, Conquest, Molo, Pathway
**Inspections:** SafetyCulture, Proludic (playgrounds), Arborcheck (trees)
**Work orders:** Council CMMS platforms, contractor portals
**GIS:** Spatial asset mapping systems
**Compliance:** Audit management, regulatory reporting systems

URL Templates auto-populate asset data—configure once, deploy across asset population.

## Getting Started

1. **Generate Links** - Bulk generation for asset population (`qrtub.com/pg-smith-01`, `qrtub.com/tree-oak-st-5`, etc.)
2. **Order asset tags** - Weatherproof materials appropriate for each asset type (metal plaques for playgrounds, vinyl for signs, aluminum for trees)
3. **Create Tubs** - Separate Tub per department or asset category
4. **Define asset fields** - Asset ID, Type, Location, Installed date, Responsible officer, Inspection due
5. **Configure Profile Pages** - Inspection/maintenance Destinations, public reporting, asset information
6. **Deploy** - Import asset inventory, each asset inherits appropriate template
7. **Tag assets** - Playgrounds, parks, buildings, equipment, trees, infrastructure

Update as systems evolve—new contractors, different platforms, changed contacts—without retagging assets.
