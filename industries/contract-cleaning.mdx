Contract cleaning teams need QR codes that serve staff performing inspections, clients who need visibility, and the general public who encounter your codes in restrooms and public spaces. qrtub provides one professional QR code per facility—everyone sees the same page, each chooses what's relevant.

## The Challenge

Cleaning companies operate across multiple facilities with:
- Staff performing electronic inspections and checklists
- Clients wanting service visibility and issue reporting
- General public encountering QR codes (potential marketing opportunity)
- Professional presentation expectations (QR codes are visible branding)
- Need to update codes across dozens of facilities when systems change

Traditional approaches waste opportunities:
- Generic inspection links miss business development when public scans
- Multiple codes per facility look unprofessional
- Direct vendor links create lock-in when switching apps
- Reprinting codes across facilities is expensive

## One Code, One Page, All Audiences See Everything

Every facility gets a single QR code. Everyone who scans sees the SAME branded Profile Page with ALL the buttons. Each person taps what's relevant to them.

**Example Profile Page:**
- Company logo and branding (everyone sees this)
- "Start Inspection" → Staff tap this
- "Report Damage" → Staff tap this
- "View Service Schedule" → Clients tap this
- "Contact Cleaning Team" → Anyone can tap this
- "Contact Us" → Public/potential clients tap this

**Here's the genius:** The public sees ALL the operational buttons (inspections, damage reporting, service logs). They won't tap them, but seeing them demonstrates you're a professional operation with proper systems—social proof that you're legitimate and professional.

**Note on security:** The buttons are visible, but they're still protected. If someone taps "Start Inspection," they reach your inspection app (SafetyCulture, Swept, etc.) which requires login credentials. The Profile Page shows what's available; your existing systems control who can actually access them.

**Guerrilla marketing in action:**

A facility manager visiting a competitor's building uses the restroom, scans the QR code out of curiosity. They see your professional branding, "Start Inspection" button, "Report Damage" button, "Log Service Completion" button, and "Contact Us."

**The operational buttons they won't use become proof of your professionalism.** That's when they contact you for their own facilities.

## The Restaurant Kitchen Effect

Traditional thinking: Hide operational details from the public.

**qrtub approach:** Show everything. It's like a restaurant with glass walls into the kitchen—the visibility builds trust.

The curious public scanning in a restroom sees:
- Digital inspection systems (legitimacy)
- Accountability processes (damage reporting)
- Documentation systems (completion logging)
- Professional branding and contact

They think: "This is a professional operation, not just a contractor with a bucket."

**Generic inspection link:** Public scans → sees form → confused → leaves.

**qrtub Profile Page:** Public scans → sees professional brand + operational legitimacy → becomes qualified lead.

Your QR codes in competitors' facilities become marketing tools when facility managers scan out of curiosity.

## Bulk Deployment Across Facilities

Configure once, deploy everywhere:

**URL Templates example:**
```
yourform.com/inspection?facility={facilityID}&name={facilityName}
```

Configure once. Deploy to 100 facilities. Each QR code automatically pre-fills inspection forms with that facility's details—no per-facility configuration needed.

**Update without reprinting:** Switch inspection apps across all 80 facilities with one Destination update. Zero reprinting. Zero downtime.

## Real-World Example: Public Restroom QR Code

A cleaning company places QR codes in high-traffic restrooms. Everyone sees the same Profile Page:

**Staff** (during cleaning):
- Tap "Start Hygiene Inspection"
- Complete checklist, log completion

**Building occupants** (if issue found):
- See all the operational buttons (impressive!)
- Tap "Report Restroom Issue"

**Curious public member** (facility manager visiting):
- Scan out of curiosity
- See "Start Hygiene Inspection" (they have inspection systems!)
- See "Report Damage" (accountability processes!)
- See "Log Completion" (documentation!)
- Think: "Professional outfit"
- Tap "Contact Cleaning Team" to inquire

**Result:** One curious restroom scan becomes a qualified sales lead. The operational buttons they didn't tap became the proof of professionalism that convinced them to make contact.

**This happens more than you think.** People scan QR codes in restrooms. Generic inspection vendor links waste this opportunity. qrtub Profile Pages turn curiosity into business development.

## Integration with Cleaning Software

qrtub connects to the tools you already use:

**Inspection platforms:** SafetyCulture (iAuditor), Swept, CleanTelligent
**Operations:** Aspire, Jobber
**Communication:** Google Forms, Airtable, client-specific portals

URL Templates auto-populate facility details—configure once, deploy to all sites.

## Getting Started

1. **Generate Links** - Bulk generation for professional printing (`qrtub.com/office-301`, etc.)
2. **Order QR codes** - Vinyl stickers, laminated cards, or metal plaques depending on location
3. **Create Tub** - Define facility fields (name, client, contact, schedule)
4. **Configure Profile Page** - Design once with your branding, staff/client Destinations
5. **Deploy** - Import facilities, each inherits your branded design with personalized Destinations
6. **Place strategically** - Restrooms, cleaning stations, supply closets, reception desks

Update as operations evolve—new clients, different apps, changed contacts—without reprinting.

## Why Cleaning Companies Choose qrtub

**Operational transparency as marketing:** Your inspection buttons visible to the public prove professionalism. Facility managers at competitor sites become leads.

**Scalable:** Configure Profile Page templates once. Deploy to 10, 50, or 100+ facilities with URL Templates.

**No vendor lock-in:** Switch inspection apps across all facilities with one update. Your QR code infrastructure stays valuable.

**Client transparency:** Offer visibility into service completion without giving access to operational tools.

**Unexpected marketing channel:** QR codes in public restrooms and high-traffic areas are scanned by curious members of the public. Everyone sees the same page with ALL operational buttons—the visibility proves capability. Facility managers at competitor sites, business owners visiting clients, property managers—all potential leads who see your operational sophistication on display.

**Generic links waste this opportunity. qrtub Profile Pages weaponize it.**
