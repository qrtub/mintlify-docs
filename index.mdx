Physical QR codes are permanent once printed - but your systems aren't. qrtub lets you change what your codes do without reprinting.

Deploy QR codes in bulk before your systems are ready. Connect them during installation. Update Destinations whenever requirements change. One QR code can do more, linking to multiple systems — inspections, maintenance, manuals, support, contact.

If you switch vendors in two years, update the Destination. Don't reprint 500 stickers.

## Why Choose qrtub?

### Print Before You're Ready
Professional printing requires bulk orders and a lead time. Don't wait until everything is finalized. Generate Links, print QR codes, and connect them when convenient.

### One Code, Multiple Systems
Normally QR Codes only do one thing for one audience. One qrtub code can do the job of many. Have one link for your staff and customers to satisfy ops and sales. Equipment needs access to inspections, maintenance logs, manuals, and support. One QR code with a Profile Page serves them all. No more cluttering items with multiple stickers.

### Future Proof
Switch software, add new systems, fix broken links—all without touching your physical QR codes. Your infrastructure stays fixed while your digital requirements evolve.

### Built for Physical Deployments
Marine operations, construction equipment, rental fleets, lifesaving stations — qrtub handles real-world deployments where QR codes need to last months or years.
