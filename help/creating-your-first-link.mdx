Links are the foundation of qrtub. Each Link is a unique URL (like `qrtub.com/r/x5fgd`) that you can encode in a QR code and manage independently.

## Step 1: Navigate to Links

From your dashboard, click **Links** in the main navigation.

## Step 2: Generate a New Link

Click the **Generate Links** button. You can create:

- **Single Link** - Generate one Link at a time
- **Bulk Links** - Generate multiple Links for professional printing

## Step 3: Choose Your Link Type

- **Random** (`qrtub.com/r/x5fgd`) - Default, automatically generated
- **ID-based** (`qrtub.com/cra001`) - Sequential or branded patterns
- **Custom** (`qrtub.com/mylink`) - Memorable, custom URLs

## Step 4: Print or Connect

Once generated, you can:

- Download QR codes for printing
- Connect the Link to an Item
- Set up a Profile Page with multiple Destinations
