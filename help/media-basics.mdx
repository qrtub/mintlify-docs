Most people think generating a QR code is all there is—just creating the digital pattern. But qrtub recognizes that QR codes get displayed on physical materials: stickers, signs, plaques, billboards, real estate signs, printed ads, NFC chips.

This physical media is what costs money and needs lifecycle management.

## Understanding the Three Entities

qrtub recognizes three distinct things in physical QR deployments:

| Entity | What It Is | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Item** | The thing being represented | An excavator, fire extinguisher, meeting room, product |
| **Link** | The qrtub-managed URL (digital pattern) | `qrtub.com/r/x5fgd` |
| **Media** | The physical material displaying the QR code | A vinyl sticker, metal plaque, billboard, real estate sign, printed ad, NFC chip |

## Why Track Media Separately?

Physical QR code media is infrastructure with real costs and lifecycle needs:

- **Cost** - A metal plaque costs $50. A billboard costs $5,000. These are infrastructure investments.
- **Durability** - Metal plaques last 10+ years. Weatherproof vinyl lasts 3-5 years. Different materials have different lifecycles.
- **Replacement** - Link history is preserved when Media is damaged or replaced
- **Inventory** - Track what's been produced, what's installed, or what's in stock
- **Production tracking** - Manage Media Batches from different print partners or production runs

## Current Media Features

**Available Now:**
- Record Media type with each Link (sticker, sign, plaque, billboard, etc.)
- Add notes about Media materials and installation
- Track basic Media information

**Planned Features:**
- Full Media lifecycle management
- Media Templates (reusable design templates)
- Media inventory tracking
- Replacement workflows
- Media Batch management (track production runs)
- Cost tracking and reporting

## Media Templates (Planned Feature)

Future functionality will include reusable design templates:

- **System-provided templates** - Standard sizes (4x6" sticker, 24x36" sign, etc.)
- **Custom templates** - Save your own designs for consistent production
- **Multi-format** - One design, multiple Media types (sticker, sign, billboard)
- **Partner integration** - Send directly to Media Partners for production

## Media Batches (Planned Feature)

Track production runs of Media:

- **Production tracking** - "Media Batch #47: 500 weatherproof vinyl stickers, printed March 2025 by PrintCo"
- **Cost allocation** - Track costs per Batch
- **Reprint management** - Same Links printed across multiple Batches over time
- **Quality control** - Track which Batch a Media item came from

## Media Partners

qrtub works with Media Partners—print shops, signage companies, engravers, and other producers who create physical Media:

- **Certified Media Partners** - Vetted producers who understand qrtub workflows
- **Template compatibility** - Partners who can work with qrtub Media Templates
- **Direct ordering** - (Future) Order Media directly through qrtub

## Choosing the Right Media

Consider these factors when selecting Media types:

**Environment:**
- Indoor → Standard vinyl stickers
- Outdoor → Weatherproof vinyl or metal plaques
- Harsh conditions → Engraved metal or ceramic

**Duration:**
- Temporary (< 1 year) → Vinyl stickers, printed materials
- Medium-term (1-5 years) → Weatherproof vinyl, rigid signs
- Permanent (10+ years) → Metal plaques, engraved signs

**Budget:**
- Low-cost deployments → Vinyl stickers, printed materials
- Infrastructure investments → Metal plaques, signs
- Marketing campaigns → Billboards, large format prints

**Application:**
- Equipment → Stickers, metal plaques
- Facilities → Signs, plaques
- Marketing → Billboards, printed ads, postcards
- Products → Stickers, NFC chips
