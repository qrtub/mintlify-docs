Profile Pages turn a single QR code into a multi-Destination landing page. Instead of one QR code per system, create one code with multiple options.

## What is a Profile Page?

When someone scans a QR code linked to a Profile Page, they see a mobile-friendly page with multiple Destinations:

- "Start Inspection" → Opens SafetyCulture
- "Log Maintenance" → Opens CMMS system
- "View Manual" → Opens documentation

## Profile Mode vs Direct Mode

| Mode | Behavior | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Profile Mode** | Opens landing page with multiple Destinations | Multi-system integration, audience routing |
| **Direct Mode** | Redirects immediately to single Destination | Simple redirects, single-purpose codes |

You can switch between modes at any time without reprinting.

## Key Benefits

**One Code, Every System**
Connect one QR code to multiple software systems. Users tap the Destination they need.

**Audience Routing**
Show different Destinations to different people:
- Staff see operational tools
- Customers see support info
- Technicians see maintenance access

**Professional Presentation**
Every scan is a branded experience. Customize colors, logos, and descriptions.

## Creating a Profile Page

Profile Pages are created when you connect a Link to an Item in a Tub:

1. Create an Item in a Tub
2. Assign a Link to the Item
3. The Item's Profile Page is automatically generated
4. Add Destinations to route users to different systems
